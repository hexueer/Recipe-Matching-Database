"Slowly add the hot water to the flour and mix it at the same time. Mix until the hot water is fully absorbed. Slowly add the cold water and continue mixing. Dough flakes should form once all the water is added. Start to press everything together with your hand. You can add a bit more water if there's too much dry flour left. Or you can slightly add a bit more flour if the dough is very sticky. Once you've pressed all the dough flakes together, you should have little or no dry flour left. Knead about 5 mins until a tough dough is formed. Let rest for 20 mins, then knead for 1 minute to form a smooth dough. Make flour oil paste. Cut the dough into 6 pieces and work on the pieces one at a time. Use your hands to shape the dough into a rectangular shape. Roll the dough. The dough should form a very thin rectangle. Add the flour oil paste. Spread out the paste, leaving about 1‚Äù (2.5 cm) on both a long and a short end without the filling (your top and left). Add the green onion, concentrating most of it towards a long and short end with the filling. Gently roll up the dough, as tightly as possible. Press the air bubbles out of the dough strip. Further roll up the long dough strip. Tuck the end on the bottom. Gently press the tall pancake. Let rest and roll out the pancakes when you're ready to cook. Heat up a pan with a layer of oil on the bottom, add the pancake, and wiggle the pancake a few times so it won't stick. Let the pancake cook covered first. Flip the pancake and cook covered again. Then cook uncovered, until both sides of the pancake are browned.",
